1. Indicators of compromise and threat intel

- The threat intel business
- cost of feeds
- quality of feeds, quality measurement
- Threat intel vs. AV as an industry, tweet from Mara 30.4.
--- An industry working with the same broken model for 20 years
--- Another industry picking up a broken model for the next 20 years?
- Referencing: Dino Dai Zovi, BlackHat Asia; Halvar, BlackHat Asia '17;
False Flag paper, Kaspersky VirusBulletin '16; Binary Handwriting, Morgan & me Blackhat '15

2. How to evaluate an indicator

- cost for buying
- time of relevance
- ease of change for an attacker
- ease of application by user
=> two price tags

3. Indicator studies

- defining types of indicators
--- Network, binaries, ..

- indicator cost types
--- extraction
--- change
--- application/deployment
--- resilience and expiry time

- case studies
--- IP addresses: buying, renting
--- URLs, domains: hosting, compromised third party servers
--- Visualizations network stuff
--- Binaries: refactoring, imports, hashes, strings, bytecode

4. Smart indicators PoC

- extraction cheap
- change expensive
- metrics from mailicious [stuff] to describe complexity
--- how expensive to extract, tool cost, time
--- resilience: how hard to change, time, know-how,
--- measuring information carried by indicators

5. The anti-virus factor: pattern matching & runtime packers

- Short case study on PackRat and commodity malware

6. Integration with MISP

- MISP taxonomy of IoCs
- objects in MISP
- feature factories
- future of indicators: MISP as a de-facto standard
(what about the others? STIX, TAXII, etc.? talking to Raph)

7. Our theory is that IoCs that are expensive for the attacker to change are better.

- We need some falsifiability though
- Does misp data show us this?
- Are some IoCs static while others associated with them get replaced?

8. Driving up cost of attack?
- Proportionality cost to deploy for defense / cost to change for attacker
- attack is cheap, defense is (more and more) expensive
- Defense companies need either your money or your data

May the bridges we burn light the way
Summary and conclusion



====================================================================
1. Indicators of compromise and threat intel

Feeds: actionable, contextual data from multiple sources
format, cost, timelyness; being able to connect data points, see through the noise
parseable for different products
Where does the data come from, geographically? How deep does the info go? Hashes vs. strings in binaries
Command line argument strings do not correlate with lists of domain names

Intelligence requirements of a company
Feed evaluation of independet reviewers
Feeds come in subscriptions, one-year, two, three
price depends on number of users, number/type of appliance, quality; start at 1500 to 3000 per month

The time black spot: historical data relevance
The geographical black spot: customers in China deliver intel for China
The data quality black spot: file hash cant be compared to domain name

History lesson - from AV to TI
ridiculous how AV sold detection products, with a cumulative TI feed; while TI now sells singular standalone feeds
AV has always just seen black and white; the road to hell is paved with good intentions
Threat modeling is an approach to data reduction and specialization
Cost of feeds nowadays limits coverage, limitations on TI heavier than ever seen in AV
No independent evaluation results of TI data available as of today

Percentage of incidents that lead to an actual breach
Percentage of threats that are major incidents
Average cost of a major incident
Percentage of threats that result in minor incidents
Average cost of a minor incident
Average annual growth of security threats and incidents

Average number of incidents per day
Number of incidents being addressed daily using current resources
Gap between addressed and unaddressed incidents
Number of incidents addressed daily using new incident management strategy

4. Smart indicators PoC

multi-threading, keylogging, network communication, string density, global variables, graph size, etc.
research originating from binary handwriting
Extraction: open source, static, feature factories
Resistance: compilers, crypters, coding habits; time, geography, depth?
Scalability: good question..
Distribution: MISP

Challenge with the more IOCs approach: We can't find the needle in the haystack, so we need more hay!
False positives in AV world vs. TI world, alerts, priorities, automated investigation approaches
ROI measurement of ThreatConnect: FP reporting; FP on a file basis vs. on the wire, alerts vs. blocking

No machine learning approach in the world will tell you, that one particular compilation timestamp was more important than another

5. The anti-virus factor: pattern matching & runtime packers

Packrat as "APT" using runtime packers, repetitive use of packers, infrastructure connects different attacks
targeted attacks are becoming cheaper as techniques are being reused, APT as a service maybe
Research on commodity RATs from I4CS Vienna
Enterprise networks vs. private computers and the runtime packers

===
7. Our theory is that IoCs that are expensive for the attacker to change are better.

Domains changing around binaries
IP addys changing around phishing mail
binaries changing around imphashes

Summary and conclusion

Money is a factor always, cause even in state sponsored hacking we can say that Somalia definitely doesn't have the same resources to spend as the US
State hacking tools sold today for compromise of "terrorists" could in the future very well be reused for economical targets or other nation state targets
reuse is a weak spot, common TI just like AV relies on reuse of code and infrastructure
